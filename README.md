This project was developed in collaboration with Caren Youssed and Sarah Rizk as final project for the database course. 
This project offers a website that allow users to manage their flights, in other terms a user can check for available flights from to a certain country, book the flight along with the convinient class, take a tour to explore the city of destination, benefit from exclusive flights, check dutyfree items availability, check weather along with more additional feature.

The project can be devided into three main steps:
* Database base design covering LDM and CDM
* Frontend development
* Backend development along with the connection between frontend and backend


# Databse Creation

Using my knowledge aquired from my internship at Netvariant, I contributed in the creation of the databse using MySql Workbench. Tables, relations, views along with users were created. Before the actual database implementation, we created the CDM and LDM model as shown below:
We should note that all traps (fan trap and chasm trap were raken into consideration)

# Frontend Development
The frontend was created by Caren and Sarah using html and css along with bootstrap. Moreover I contributed by including some animations such as social media icons and error page. We should not that javascript was included also and linked to the backend for data validation.

# Backend Development

The backend was created using jsp(java server page) It is a server side technology used for creating web application. It is used to create dynamic web content + sevlet. The website ws tested locally on AppacheTomcat Server. We should note that OOP principales were used. This enable faster response since an instance of the object is created instead of accessing and fetching all record each time a request is made.
The dependencies used:
* jsp-api
* jstl
* mysql-connector
* servlet-annotation-spec
* servlet-api

The backend is linked to the database and then the frontend. Therefore any request is processed and validated by choosing the corresponding method and class than the information is sent back to be posted on the front end. Below is an example:

# Demo
Note: All data shown in each page is fetched from our database
